</p>

**TTCS (Test-Time Curriculum Synthesis)** is a co-evolving test-time training framework built on an iterative GRPO optimization loop. It consists of two agents: a **Synthesizer** policy $\pi_{\phi}$ and a **Solver** policy $\pi_{\theta}$, both initialized from the same pretrained model.

At each iteration:
- The **Synthesizer** generates curriculum variants for each test question, rewarded to preserve the reasoning structure while staying near the Solver's current capability frontier.
- The **Solver** performs online self-evolving on a mixture of synthetic and test questions, guided by self-consistency rewards.

The two agents **co-evolve in a closed loop**: the Solver's current performance provides a capability-aware training signal that shapes the Synthesizer's generation distribution, while the Synthesizer continuously supplies fresh, question-centered variants that stabilize the Solver's test-time training.

### Key Features

* **Test-Time Curriculum Synthesis:** Generates structured, localized curriculum variants around each test question, allowing the Solver to learn from simpler, related variants.
* **Capability-Aware Training:** Question Quality Reward prioritizes synthetic questions at the Solver's capability frontier—neither too easy nor too hard.
* **Co-Evolutionary Learning:** A unique Synthesizer-Solver dynamic creates targeted, adaptive curriculum for mathematical reasoning.
* **Self-Consistency Rewards:** Uses majority voting mechanism to obtain pseudo-labels without external supervision.
* **Model-Agnostic:** Consistently improves performance across various backbone LLMs (1.5B to 7B parameters).

## ⚡️ Quickstart Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/TTCS.git
cd TTCS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Paths

Set up environment variables for your storage paths:

```bash
# Base directory for all data and results
export TTCS_BASE_DIR="/path/to/your/base"

# Model directory
export TTCS_MODEL_DIR="/path/to/your/models"

# Data directory
export TTCS_DATA_DIR="/path/to/your/data"

# Results directory
export TTCS_SAVED_RESULTS_DIR="/path/to/saved_results"
```

### 3. Run Training

The main entry point is `run_with_gpus.sh`, which handles GPU allocation and launches the training pipeline:

```bash
# Run with 4 GPUs
bash src/script/run_with_gpus.sh 4

# Run with 8 GPUs
bash src/script/run_with_gpus.sh 8
```

The script will:
1. Detect available GPUs and wait for sufficient resources
2. Automatically allocate GPUs for Synthesizer and Solver training
3. Launch the iterative co-evolutionary training loop
4. Run evaluation after training completes

### 4. Run Evaluation Only

To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
bash evaluation/eval.sh <variant_name> <eval_step> <num_iterations> <base_model_name> <dataset>
```


## ❓ FAQ

### Q: What hardware is required?

**A:** Our experiments were conducted on servers with 4-8 GPUs. The minimum recommended setup is 4 GPUs (2 for Synthesizer, 2 for Solver/Reward). For larger models, 8 GPUs are recommended.

### Q: How long does training take?

**A:** Training time depends on the model size and number of iterations. For Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B with 4 GPUs, each iteration takes approximately 4-5 hours.

### Q: Can I use a different base model?

**A:** Yes! TTCS is model-agnostic. Modify the `TTCS_BASE_MODEL_NAME` and `TTCS_BASE_MODEL_PATH` environment variables to use your preferred model.

### Q: Where are checkpoints saved?

**A:** Checkpoints are saved in `${TTCS_SAVED_RESULTS_DIR}/Solver_ttrl/` and `${TTCS_SAVED_RESULTS_DIR}/Synthesizer_ttrl/` for Solver and Synthesizer respectively.
